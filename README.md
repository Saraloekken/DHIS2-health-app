## Working list 

## Description: 
This project is created in regards to the Covid-19 pandemic, and is an app made for health workers and contact tracers to help keep track of the positive registered cases as well as the contacts of these cases. This version currently handles the data for Nesodden municipality. 

## Motivation: 
Our motivation for this project is to learn more about application design and development within platform ecosystems.
We want to to improve ourselves on the use of Git, Javascript, React, CSS and the use of APIs. 

## Technologies: 
We retrieve trackedEntityInstances in the datafiles `IndexCasesApi`, `ContactsApi` and `RelationsApi`. For each of the files, data is used in components where data is added to a list. This list is created in the the pages `Index Cases`, `Contacts`, and `Index Cases and Contacts` using the `DataTable` component.

Data is filtered in the `Filters` component, by clicking a new field in the menu, the "from" and "two" state variables are updated in the `Contacts`, `Index Cases` and `Relations` (Index Cases and Contacts) pages. By clicking custom and selecting dates in the calendars, the DatePicker component is being used.

When you click "view contacts" in `RelationsApi`, index case data will be sent to `ModalApi`, where a table is placed in a modal. Data for this table is created in `ContactsApi`.

## Main functionalities:  
Overview of index cases  
Overview of contacts  
Overview of both  
Directed to data entry form   
Generate overview of workload  
“Sub-view” with contacts linked to same case  

## Extras: 
Keep track of the cases and contacts they need to follow up on  
Lists of persons they should contact at any given time  
Sort different cases and contacts by time frames  
Simplify the work process of the workers  
User-friendly interface  
Easy and simple!   

## Missing functionality/possible improvements: 
Previous follow-ups/completed  
Search-function  
Alert/notice box when a tracker capture has been confirmed  
A status filter that filters on: "All", "Completed", "Active" and "Scheduled"  
Save filter for session  
Sort ascending/descending by different table columns

## API-reference: 
Getting a list of index cases and contacts:  
/api/trackedEntityInstances

Getting a list of required and optional attributes:  
/api/trackedEntityAttributes/

## How to use: 
This application is divided into three different pages. All of the pages consist of tables that are sorted by due date in an ascending order.

Index Cases shows a view of contacts that have tested positive for Covid-19, and will be handled specifically by health workers with a medical background.  

Contacts consists of people who have been close to a positive case, and will mainly be handled by contact tracers.  

Relations shows a combination of these two. If you click on an index case, a modal with the people they have been in contact with will show up.  

When a health worker or a contact tracers follows up on a case, they can click the blue "tracker caption" button. This will take them directly to the tracker capture app, where they can edit the case info, set a new date for follow-up or mark the case as recovered. 

Usage of the different statuses in the table:<br />
SCHEDULE - events with due date in the future, and no event date<br />
OVERDUE - events with due date in the past, and no event date<br />
ACTIVE - events with an event date, that is not COMPLETE (independent of due date)<br />
VISITED - special case of ACTIVE

This project was bootstrapped with [DHIS2 Application Platform](https://github.com/dhis2/app-platform).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

Installs all dependencies for the project. 

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner and runs all available tests found in `/src`.<br />

See the section about [running tests](https://platform.dhis2.nu/#/scripts/test) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
A deployable `.zip` file can be found in `build/bundle`!
