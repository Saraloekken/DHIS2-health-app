## Working list 

## Description: 
This project is created in regards to the Covid-19 pandemic, and is an app made for health-workers and contact tracers to help keep track of the positive registered cases as well as the contacts of these cases. This version currently handles the data for Nesodden municipality. 

## Motivation: 
Our motivation for this project is to learn more about application design and development within platform ecosystems.
We want to to improve ourselves on the use of Git, Javascript, React and the use of APIs. 

## Technologies: 
React.js - https://reactjs.org/  
DHIS2 - https://www.dhis2.org/

## Main functionalities:  
Overview of index cases  
Overview of contacts  
Overview of both  
Directed to data entry form   
Generate overview of workload  
“Sub-view” with contacts linked to same case  

## Extras: 
Keep track of the cases and contacts they need to follow up on  
Lists of persons they should contact at any given time  
Sort different cases and contacts by time frames  
Simplify the work process of the workers  
User-friendly interface  
Easy and simple!   

## Missing functionality/possible improvements: 
Previous follow-ups/completed 
Search-function
Alert/notice box when a tracker capture has been confirmed
A status filter that filters on: "All", "Completed", "Active" and "Scheduled" 
Save filter for session 

## API-reference: 
Getting a list of index cases and contacts:  
/api/trackedEntityInstances

Getting a list of required and optional attributes:  
/api/trackedEntityAttributes/

## How to use: 
This application is divided into three different pages.  

Index Cases shows a view of contacts that have tested positive for Covid-19, and is to be handles specifically by health workers with a medical background.  
Contacts consists of people who have been close to a positive case, and will mainly be handled by contact tracers.  
Relations shows a combination of these two. If you click on an index case, a modal with the people they have been in contact with will show up.  

When a health worker or a contact tracers follows up on a case, they can click the blue tracker caption button. This will take them directly to the tracker capture app, where they can edit the case info, set a new date for follow-up, or mark the case as recovered.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

Installs all dependencies for the project. 

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
